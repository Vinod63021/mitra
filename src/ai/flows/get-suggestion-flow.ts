Analyze the following user data:

Symptom Log & Journal:
- Mood: {{{mood}}}
- Skin: {{{skin}}}
- Pain: {{{pain}}}
- Period: {{{period}}}
- Discharge: {{{discharge}}}
- Hair Growth: {{{hairGrowth}}}
- Journal Entry: {{{journalText}}}

Based on this combined information, provide the following:

1.  **Emotional Reflection**:
    *   Analyze the sentiment of the journal entry (positive, negative, or neutral).
    *   Determine a 'twinColor' that reflects this emotional state: "Blue" for sad/negative, "Red" for stressed/anxious, "Green" for calm/positive/neutral.
    *   Offer a 'moodBasedSuggestion' tailored to this sentiment (e.g., if sad: "Try 5-min mindful breathing"; if stressed: "Write a gratitude note"; if neutral/positive: "Acknowledge your positive state!").

2.  **Symptom Analysis**:
    *   Predict the 'nextExpectedPeriod' date based on the symptom log.
    *   Assess the 'cycleIrregularityRisk' (e.g., low, medium, high).
    *   Provide any 'diabetesInfertilityAlerts' if indicated by the symptoms.

3.  **Personalized Guidance**:
    *   **Detailed Remedies**: Provide a list of 'detailedRemedies'. Each remedy should have a 'name', 'description' of its benefits, and optional 'instructions'. Suggest at least two distinct remedies.
    *   **Food Recommendations**: Provide a list of 'foodRecommendations'. Each food should have a 'name', its 'benefits' for PCOS or well-being, and an 'imageUrlHint' (one or two keywords like "broccoli florets" or "salmon fillet" - max two words). Suggest at least three distinct food items.
    *   **Actionable Tips**: Provide a list of at least three distinct 'actionableTips' as strings. These should be practical lifestyle suggestions.

4.  **Holistic Summary**:
    *   Provide a 'holisticSummary' that combines insights from the emotional reflection, symptom analysis, and integrates the provided remedies, food recommendations, and tips. This summary should offer actionable advice that considers the interplay between their feelings, physical symptoms, and the suggested guidance.

Ensure your output is comprehensive, empathetic, and structured according to the output schema.
The output must be parsable by JSON.`,
